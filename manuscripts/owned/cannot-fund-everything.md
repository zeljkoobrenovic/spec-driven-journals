# 10. You Cannot Fund Every Good Project at Once

![You Cannot Fund Every Good Project at Once — logo](private-techuity/posts/28-cannot-fund-everything/assets/images/28-cannot-fund-everything/logo.jpeg)

> **IN THIS SECTION, YOU WILL:** Learn to choose a combination of work that fits both the cash and the team time available, and revise the whole combination when a test fails.

> **WHY INVESTORS CARE:** The growth plan the investment was agreed on assumes onboarding volume can rise without proportional staff. The pilot that tests that assumption competes for the same engineer-weeks as an agreed recovery obligation, and every draw on the reserve returns to the board, where the investor sits; a plan that overcommits the team shows up there as slippage.

> **WHY YOU SHOULD CARE:** A plan that fits the cash but not the team time, or ignores an agreed obligation, gets overrun by the constraint nobody counted; choosing the feasible combination is what makes commitments deliverable.

> **KEY POINTS:**
>
> * Choose a **combination of work the company can actually deliver**. Several attractive projects can fit the cash limit and still exceed the team time available.
> * Sort the requests by **what they rest on**: an agreed obligation, tested customer evidence or an assumption. A growth target starts the discussion; it does not choose the project.
> * Make the **next review part of the decision**, and revise the whole combination, not just one project, when a test fails or new evidence arrives.

Larkspur’s investor wants faster growth. Priya, the product leader, has requests for a new customer portal. Alex, the technology leader, wants to improve recovery from system failures. The customer team wants simpler setup for new accounts. Each request has a plausible benefit. They can’t all use the same people at the same time.

A **company investment** commits resources now in the expectation of a future benefit. **Team capacity** is the time and capability people have available to do the work. Choosing investments needs both a cash plan and a capacity plan. This chapter shows one way to make the choice, as a proposed working method illustrated with fictional figures.

{id: cannot-fund-everything--three-requests-two-limits}
## Three Requests, Two Limits

In this **fictional planning exercise**, the Larkspur board authorizes one envelope for the first hundred days after closing: up to €500,000 of additional cash and 24 engineer-weeks. It is the same plan that [The First Hundred Days: Turn Expectations Into a Funded Plan](#first-hundred-days) follows from the diligence findings to the day-100 review; this chapter shows how the combination inside it was chosen and then revised. Ines, the CEO, proposes the combination, and the board approves it at the meeting that adopts the operating plan (day 0). Routine operating work is already budgeted. The change budget must also fund the improvement needed to meet the agreed recovery requirement. One **engineer-week** means one person’s working time for one week; it’s a planning estimate, not a guarantee that people are interchangeable.

The cash estimates concern additional spending, such as specialist help and new services. Existing employees’ pay is already in the ordinary operating budget; their available time is shown separately. The identifiers in the table (REC-1, ONB-1, KNW-1) are the ones the diligence findings and the [Practical Tools for Ownership and Technology Decisions](#toolkit) use for the same work.

| Proposed work | Additional cash | Engineer-weeks | Intended result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Improve and test service restoration (REC-1) | €80,000 | 4 | Meet the company’s agreed recovery requirement |
| Simplify one customer-setup step (ONB-1) | €180,000 | 12 | Test whether customers can start using the product with less help |
| Free a second engineer to release and recover the scheduling engine (KNW-1) | €0 | 4 protected specialist-weeks, outside the 24 | Remove a dependency on one person |
| Build the full proposed customer portal | €220,000 | 12 | Offer a broader way for customers to manage their work |
| Test the portal need with customer research | €20,000 | 2 | Learn which problems would justify a larger product commitment |
| **All proposed work** | **€500,000** | **30 of the 24, plus 4 protected** | **Fits the cash limit but exceeds available engineering time** |

The money fits. The time does not. KNW-1 changes neither total: it needs no additional cash, and its four weeks are the scheduling specialist’s time, protected from the operating budget rather than drawn from the 24. It is in the table because the plan has to say that nothing else may claim that time. The portal research comes before a full build; the table shows what funding both stages would require, and the company still has to decide whether the research justifies that later commitment.

The totals are only a first check. Confirm that the required specialists are available in the weeks each project needs them. Twenty-four engineer-weeks spread across several teams or months may not support a plan that needs the same specialist for twelve consecutive weeks.

{id: cannot-fund-everything--sort-the-rows-by-what-they-rest-on}
## Sort the Rows by What They Rest On

Before choosing among the rows, establish what each one depends on. The table gives every row the same shape; the rows are not the same kind of choice.

**An agreed obligation.** Some work protects an existing commitment: continuing a contracted service, meeting an applicable requirement or resolving a risk the company has decided it can’t accept. At Larkspur the board has agreed a recovery requirement, and the restoration row is what meeting it costs. KNW-1 is the other obligation on the table: diligence found that only one person could release and recover the scheduling engine, and the company decided not to carry that risk. That doesn’t make every proposed security or maintenance project mandatory. Establish the specific obligation or failure scenario, the minimum acceptable result and the feasible alternatives, with specialist interpretation where necessary. The company still chooses how to meet the need.

**An expected result.** An **investment thesis** is the investor’s explanation of why the investment should succeed; it is a revisable prediction, not an instruction. Larkspur’s says the company can grow faster. “Grow faster” could mean winning more customers, activating customers already waiting or helping existing customers buy additional services. Those are different problems, and more marketing won’t fix a setup process that can’t handle the customers already sold. For each row, ask what evidence supports the intended result: a customer request, a tested constraint and a guess deserve different confidence.

**Dependencies and displaced work.** The **opportunity cost** of a choice is the benefit of the best alternative you give up. If two rows need the same specialist, approving one delays the other even when both have funding. Include preparation, transition, continuing operation and the work each row pushes aside.

**What a smaller step could teach.** An **experiment** is a limited test designed to learn whether an assumption holds. Its immediate result may be a better decision rather than revenue. The portal research row is one; it exists because the portal’s benefit is the least supported claim on the table.

{id: cannot-fund-everything--the-condition-that-applies-here}
## The Condition That Applies Here

This arrangement changes the conditions of the decision. Establish the actual funding, authority and deadline before committing. In this exercise the condition is specific: Larkspur’s growth funding was agreed on a plan that assumes onboarding volume can rise substantially without proportional growth in the implementation team. That gives the setup row a priority the company’s own view might not, and it makes the pilot’s evidence a condition of the next expansion step. Other funding arrangements set other conditions; [Match the Funding to the Work](#raise-what-you-need) compares them, and the [OWNED — Reading Guide](#reading-guide) explains how the book’s alternative scenarios relate to each other.

A board that wants the expansion date without funding the necessary capacity has an unresolved choice. **Present the feasible combinations.** Don’t turn the gap into an unrecorded demand for the team to work harder. A plan chosen by team preference or the loudest request has a specific weakness: it leaves out the constraint that will actually bind, the money and capacity available and the result the funding was agreed on, so it can’t say what it displaces or what evidence would change it.

{id: cannot-fund-everything--select-the-combination}
## Select the Combination

Suppose the recovery requirement is agreed, the setup constraint is supported by customer evidence and the portal’s benefit remains uncertain. Ines proposes restoration, the smaller setup change and the customer research, with KNW-1’s protected time alongside them, and the board approves that plan. It uses €280,000 and 18 engineer-weeks, leaving €220,000 and six engineer-weeks uncommitted.

Record the decision in full:

- **Chosen:** restoration, REC-1 (€80,000, four weeks); the setup change, ONB-1 (€180,000, twelve weeks); the portal research (€20,000, two weeks); and KNW-1 (no additional cash, four protected specialist-weeks outside the 24).
- **Rejected for now:** the full portal build. The unused money doesn’t make it feasible: its twelve engineer-weeks still exceed the remaining six, and its benefit still needs investigation. Deferred and recorded rather than rejected: hiring two implementation specialists (about €300,000 a year, recurring) and the second-country expansion, both waiting on the pilot’s evidence.
- **Funding and scarce capacity:** €280,000 of the €500,000 envelope; 18 of 24 engineer-weeks, with the implementation specialist needed by the setup change for twelve consecutive weeks and the scheduling specialist’s four weeks protected for KNW-1.
- **Authority:** Ines proposes; the board approves the plan and the envelope. Inside the approved plan Ines authorizes spending; any draw on the reserve, and any change to what the envelope funds, stays with the board. [Decide Who Decides, Before You Disagree](#decide-who-decides) records that delegation rule. Alex is accountable for restoration and KNW-1, Priya for the setup change and the research.
- **Evidence that would change it:** research showing the portal is essential to retain a major customer, or a first setup cohort showing no reduction in effort.

The remaining €220,000 and six weeks provide room for uncertainty and for a later decision. They aren’t automatically savings or permission to start another project, and drawing on them is the board’s decision, not Ines’s. The review below shows what part of them was for.

An estimated score can help organize this conversation, but it shouldn’t hide that an agreed obligation, a speculative product opportunity and a learning step answer different questions. **Explain the trade-off in words** as well as numbers.

**Figure 1:** *A project can be affordable and still be impossible to schedule.*

{id: cannot-fund-everything--make-the-commitment-in-stages-where-that-helps}
## Make the Commitment in Stages Where That Helps

A **funding stage** commits resources for a defined piece of work before deciding whether to commit more. The stage needs a useful outcome or a decision it can inform. Dividing a project into calendar phases doesn’t by itself reduce risk.

For the portal, the research is the first stage; the next decision might be to build a narrow function, investigate another need or stop. For restoration, the stage is the test itself: can the service recover within the agreed conditions?

Check the connections between stages. Can the company operate safely if it stops after the first? **Who maintains anything already delivered?** What spending is unavoidable once the first commitment is made? Some transitions require a larger coordinated commitment, which should be visible from the start.

**Figure 2:** *Commit enough to answer the next decision, then use the evidence before committing more.*

{id: cannot-fund-everything--review-the-combination-not-just-each-project}
## Review the Combination, Not Just Each Project

New evidence can change the whole plan, and in this exercise it did. Restoration had been authorized at €80,000 and four engineer-weeks. By the day-45 test all of it had been spent: on the restore environment, on access to the backup store, on fifteen-minute backups and on the test itself. The service came back after eleven hours against the agreed four, because a departed engineer’s credential was missing and the database version the backup needed was no longer available ([Prove You Can Restore, Not Just That You Back Up](#prove-you-can-restore) walks through the failure). The €80,000 and four weeks are **sunk cost**: resources already spent that can’t be recovered. They belong in the record, but the next commitment depends on remaining costs and expected benefits, and the obligation has not gone away.

Correcting the two faults, with a version-matched restore environment and managed credentials under a two-person procedure, then a written rehearsal and a retest, needs about €20,000 and two more engineer-weeks. Those can only come from the uncommitted reserve, and the reserve is the board’s. Ines’s delegation covers spending inside the approved plan; it excludes any draw on the reserve and any change to what the envelope funds ([Decide Who Decides, Before You Disagree](#decide-who-decides) records the rule). So around day 47 Ines asks the board, and the board approves. The revised commitment:

- **Chosen:** the correction and a retest by day 85 are added, taking restoration to €100,000 and six engineer-weeks in total; the setup change, KNW-1 and the portal research continue unchanged. Total committed: €300,000 and 20 engineer-weeks; €200,000 and four engineer-weeks remain in reserve.
- **Rejected:** pausing the setup change to free its specialist for recovery work, because its cohort evidence is the condition on the expansion decision; and starting the portal build with the remaining money, which is still infeasible in capacity and still unsupported by evidence.
- **Funding and scarce capacity:** €20,000 and two of the six spare engineer-weeks, in the weeks the operations lead is available for the retest.
- **Authority:** the board, on Ines’s request, because the money is a reserve draw. Alex remains accountable for the result.
- **Evidence that would change it:** a second failed test, which would send the remaining reserve to recovery before anything else and delay the setup change’s second cohort.

The retest passed at day 85, and the sequence continued in the same way. At the day-100 review the board drew the last €40,000 and four weeks for a data-quality step the setup cohort had pointed to, which took the envelope to €340,000 committed and all 24 engineer-weeks used, with €160,000 of cash still in reserve. [The First Hundred Days: Turn Expectations Into a Funded Plan](#first-hundred-days) carries that review; the point here is that each step changed the combination, and each was decided by the body that owned the reserve.

Review the starting assumptions, actual spending, team burden and observed outcomes together, not project by project. A supplier failure may use the spare capacity. Customer research may invalidate an expected benefit. One completed improvement may remove the need for another. Decide which work continues, which changes and which stops.

{id: cannot-fund-everything--keep-the-record}
## Keep the Record

The [Practical Tools for Ownership and Technology Decisions](#toolkit)’s record for comparing investment choices and capacity (Tool 12) holds exactly the fields used above: the required commitments, the money and team time available, the options, the combination proposed, the first stages and the review decision. Fill it in before the board conversation, and update it after each review rather than starting a new one; the same Larkspur ledger runs from the diligence findings to the handover record.

The setup change was chosen on customer evidence. Whether its benefit is real is a separate question, and the next chapter follows that one change from the work proposed to the measured customer and business result: [The Chain From Roadmap to Revenue Breaks Easily](#roadmap-to-revenue).

{id: cannot-fund-everything--questions-to-consider}
## Questions to Consider

1. *For your current plan, what are the cash limit and the capacity limit, which one binds first, and does the plan say what is already budgeted and what it must still fund?*
2. *Which of your commitments rest on an agreed obligation, which on tested evidence and which on an assumption? Are they being compared as if they were the same kind of choice?*
3. *When the last plan was reviewed, was the whole combination reconsidered or only each project’s progress, and did the reserve go where the evidence pointed?*

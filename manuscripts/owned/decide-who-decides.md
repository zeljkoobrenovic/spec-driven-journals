# 8. Decide Who Decides, Before You Disagree

![Decide Who Decides, Before You Disagree — logo](private-techuity/posts/05-decide-who-decides/assets/images/05-decide-who-decides/logo.jpeg)

> **IN THIS SECTION, YOU WILL:** Learn to fill in who proposes, approves, funds and carries out a decision, and plan what happens when the approval does not arrive in time.

> **WHY INVESTORS CARE:** Where an investor has negotiated approval rights or reserved matters, it did so precisely so that consequential decisions reach it. An adviser’s remark treated as an instruction bypasses that agreed process; an approval that is never recorded leaves the investor exposed to a plan it did not authorize.

> **WHY YOU SHOULD CARE:** A suggestion from someone close to the investor can start a project nobody approved, and an approval that never arrives can silently become a delivery failure; clear authority prevents both.

> **KEY POINTS:**
>
> * Agree **who is authorized to decide** before disagreement arises. A suggestion from someone close to the investor can sound like an instruction.
> * Fill in the record with **names, thresholds and dates**. “Management recommends, the board approves” tells nobody whom to call on a Tuesday, or by when.
> * Plan the **missed-deadline branch**. If the approval does not arrive, take the remaining options back to the person authorized to decide and tell the team which funded plan it is executing.

Morgan, the technology adviser working for the investment firm, mentions over coffee that the fictional software company Larkspur should probably change its cloud provider, the supplier of its rented computing services. Alex, the chief technology officer (**CTO**), hears an instruction from the new shareholder and starts planning a migration. Morgan thought they were offering an idea.

This is a problem of **governance**: the arrangements for making decisions, overseeing them and holding people responsible. Good intentions can’t replace an agreed decision process.

Informal influence and unclear delegation exist under any ownership; a founder’s offhand remark can start a project just as easily. An investment changes the conditions of the decision. It can add board seats, approval thresholds, **reserved matters** (decisions that require a specified party’s approval) and advisers who speak, or seem to speak, for a shareholder. Their requests are easy to overweight or underweight, and either mistake lands on product and engineering teams. Establish the actual authority, funding and deadline before committing.

Part I followed the money. This chapter begins Part II by examining what an investment can change about your authority and accountability. It uses three Larkspur illustrations rather than one. The cloud remark establishes the boundary of an adviser’s influence. A separate onboarding proposal shows the full approval process, from a filled-in decision record to what happens when the approval it depends on is late. A scheduling-engine rewrite, later in the chapter, shows how a board should challenge a technical choice.

The cast is fictional. Ines is Larkspur’s chief executive officer (**CEO**), Alex its CTO, Sam its chief financial officer (**CFO**) and Priya its product leader. Morgan is the **investor’s technology adviser**, the role this book calls the Technology Principal. Their titles describe their work; their actual approval rights need to be agreed.

{id: decide-who-decides--establish-what-has-changed}
## Establish What Has Changed

**Authority** means permission to make a particular decision. New ownership can change it directly through agreed rights, or change how people expect you to exercise it. Compare the arrangements before and after the investment using actual company documents and conversations with the responsible leaders.

| Area | What to establish |
| --- | --- |
| Ownership | Who now holds shares, and which rights come with them? |
| Priorities | Which customer, financial or operating outcomes are now expected, and why? |
| Approval | Which hiring, spending, product or transaction decisions need approval, from whom and by when? |
| Accountability | Who is accountable for each result, what resources have been committed and how will progress be assessed? |

Applied to the cloud suggestion, the table settles the matter in a minute. Larkspur’s board has authorized Ines to approve spending up to €500,000 inside the approved plan (a fictional threshold). Two kinds of decision stay with the board whatever the amount. Any draw on a reserve, and any change to what an approved envelope funds, is the board’s: Ines spends inside the plan, she doesn’t rewrite it. Permanent hires outside the approved headcount plan are the board’s as well. No reserved matter covers the choice of cloud provider. Morgan holds no approval right; the investment firm’s rights are exercised through its board seat. So the suggestion is an idea for Alex to evaluate, and a migration would need Ines’s approval or, above the threshold, the board’s. Alex records it as an option to cost, not as a plan, and tells Morgan so. These are the delegation rules the rest of this chapter, and the later chapters that draw on a reserve, refer back to.

An investment doesn’t automatically change every entry. Recording what stayed the same helps when employees are unsure whether earlier authority still applies. If you inherited the ownership arrangement, begin with the decisions ahead rather than assuming you took part in agreeing the original terms.

Distinguishing the decision-makers matters because they approve different things. The fund’s **investment committee** approved the investment in Larkspur; it does not approve Larkspur’s hiring plan. The company’s board and executives approve company work. Operating professionals from the investment firm contribute expertise. Lenders can hold contractual rights that constrain all of them. The survey of private equity investors by Gompers and colleagues documents attention to governance, financing and value creation; it doesn’t establish a uniform organization chart. [S04: PE practitioner survey](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21133) KKR’s public description of Capstone, its in-house operating-support team, similarly places operating support alongside investment teams, boards and company management: a stated delivery model, not proof that every intervention succeeds.

## Write Down Who Decides What

Replace the generic diagram with names and rights. Priya and Alex want to spend €1 million automating **onboarding**, the setup needed before a customer can use the product. Their decision record looks like this:

| | Larkspur’s answer |
| --- | --- |
| Decision | Spend €1 million automating customer onboarding |
| Who recommends | Priya, the product leader, with Alex, the CTO |
| Who resolves trade-offs | Ines, the CEO |
| Investor adviser’s contribution | Test whether the 80-hour implementation figure holds across customer types; supply comparable onboarding patterns |
| Whose approval is needed | The board, because the amount exceeds the €500,000 Ines is authorized to approve |
| Response time | Two weeks: the budget cycle closes at month end |
| Evidence that would change the recommendation | Implementation effort that varies widely by customer type, which would favor a narrower first step |

This is the €1 million program discussed in [Find the Cash Behind Your Technology Budget](#obligations-before-budget), not an approved commitment to spend it. The board still needs a feasible funding plan, and [You Cannot Fund Every Good Project at Once](#cannot-fund-everything) shows why it may fund a smaller step first.

Names and thresholds make the record usable. A useful record also names a response time. **Escalation** means taking an unresolved issue to someone authorized to decide it. An escalation route that takes six weeks is useless for a financing deadline or a service failure. Treating every architectural disagreement as an emergency fails the other way: it stops company leadership from exercising judgment.

**Figure 1:** *Decision rights clarify how an idea becomes an authorized, funded commitment.*

Read as roles rather than names, the same record generalizes into a lookup table. Adapt it to actual company documents; it doesn’t assert that an investor’s adviser holds any of these rights.

| Decision | Company contribution | Investor adviser’s possible contribution | Approval to verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product priorities within an agreed budget | Product leader and CTO recommend; CEO resolves major trade-offs | Challenge assumptions and supply evidence | Executive delegation and any reserved matters |
| Material technology investment | Management prepares options and the financial case | Test technical feasibility and delivery dependencies | Board, shareholder or financing approvals where required |
| CTO appointment | CEO defines the need and the process | Help assess candidates and context | The actual appointment authority |
| Executive appointment (a chief product officer, a head of engineering) | CEO writes the role design, runs the selection and appoints | Introduce candidates and help assess them against the company’s design | The appointment authority, plus any reserved matter over executive officers’ hiring, dismissal or pay |
| Change to the headcount plan (hires beyond it, a freeze) | Management shows what each role delivers and what a conditional role waits for | Benchmark and challenge the shape of the hire | The board for hires outside the approved plan; the CEO within it |
| Reduction or restructuring | Management costs the alternatives, names the work that stops and the cash by date | Benchmarks from other companies, which are information rather than instruction | The board for a change to what the plan funds, any reserved matter over the operating plan, and the employment law of the jurisdiction |
| Acquisition integration | Executives are accountable for the integration plan | Assess sequencing, capacity and reusable support | Transaction and operating governance |

## Several Investors Do Not Make One Decision-Maker

In a fictional minority round, Larkspur’s founder keeps most voting shares. One new investor receives a board seat; another receives specified approval rights. Alex is asked for three different versions of the hiring plan. The right response is to establish which forum can approve the company’s plan and bring the alternatives there. Adding all the requests to the roadmap would turn unresolved shareholder disagreement into the team’s delivery problem.

The National Venture Capital Association publishes separate model documents for share purchases, investor rights and voting arrangements. Its overview also describes time- or milestone-based funding mechanisms. This supports looking beyond an ownership percentage; it doesn’t establish the terms of any particular company’s agreement. [S61: NVCA model-document overview](https://nvca.org/model-legal-documents/)

With a controlling financial sponsor, ask which decisions remain delegated to management and which require approval. With a corporate parent, map the local board and executives alongside group product, security, finance and procurement functions. A minority corporate investment doesn’t by itself establish that group hierarchy.

**Record the source of each relevant authority**, the decision threshold and the response time in language the team can use. When shareholders disagree, the board or another authorized body has to resolve the choice; what that body is, and what happens in a deadlock, depends on the actual agreements. The product and engineering leader supplies the options, evidence and consequences. Shareholder disagreement can’t be resolved by silently promising incompatible work.

{id: decide-who-decides--connect-technical-choices-to-the-business-outcome}
## Connect Technical Choices to the Business Outcome

In a separate illustration, Alex proposes rewriting Larkspur’s scheduling engine because it is hard to change. The board asks how that supports growth. Alex answers that the current stack is dated. The exchange produces heat but little information.

A better challenge asks for the constrained business outcome: which customer need can’t be served, how often the constraint bites and what it costs. Alex can then compare a focused change, a staged replacement and the full rewrite. Sam can compare their cash profiles with the €0.5 million remaining in the annual planning example ([Find the Cash Behind Your Technology Budget](#obligations-before-budget)). The board can decide whether to fund an option and accept its risks. It hasn’t become an architecture committee; it has required the connection between an investment and the business plan to be made explicit.

The same discipline applies in reverse. “Cut engineering by 20%” isn’t a complete operating plan. Which work disappears? Which obligations remain? What happens to customer commitments and operational coverage? If the decision is still to cut, record its expected consequences rather than quietly converting them into impossible delivery promises.

Requests of that kind reach a company leader in three forms that sound alike and are not. A **formal approval right** comes from the agreements: a reserved matter, a board seat, a consent over executive pay or the operating plan. The response is to bring the authorized body a decision it can take. A **funding condition** attaches money to a plan: a bridge drawn only once a cost plan is adopted, a round whose term sheet wants a particular executive in place. The response is to translate the condition into a date and a number, and decide whether to meet it. **Influence** is everything else: an adviser’s benchmark, a director’s view of a leader, an introduction. The response is to record it as an option and assess it on the same evidence as any other. [Fix the Decision Problem Before Adding People](#fix-decisions-before-hiring) works an investor-proposed appointment through that distinction, and [When the Headcount Plan Shrinks](#headcount-plan-shrinks) a reduction, where all three arrive at the same board meeting.

{id: decide-who-decides--make-a-conditional-commitment-explicit-and-plan-the-missed-deadline}
## Make a Conditional Commitment Explicit, and Plan the Missed Deadline

Back to the onboarding proposal. The board answered within the two weeks. It did not approve the €1 million program in one year. It endorsed the direction and confirmed the first stage Ines had already approved within her delegation in [Find the Cash Behind Your Technology Budget](#obligations-before-budget): the reusable setup step as a pilot, €180,000 for the build plus €30,000 of first-year maintenance, €210,000 from the year’s residual and opening cash, and twelve engineer-weeks of the current team. It kept the two implementation hires as its own decision, because permanent hires outside the approved headcount plan are the board’s whatever they cost.

Alex can deliver that first stage by October if the two hires start in June, or by January with the current team. The hires would cost about €175,000 for June to December and about €300,000 a year after that, recurring: well inside Ines’s €500,000 amount, but a board decision because they add permanent headcount. The operating record states both dates and the approval condition in full: the board decides the hires at its May meeting, on two pieces of evidence, Sam’s first-quarter collections against plan and Priya’s report on the first three pilot implementations. “October, subject to the hiring approval in May” is a decision proposal; an unconditional October promise would hide a dependency.

The January plan is not a hope. Its cash is the €210,000 already authorized and identified in the cash plan. Its capacity is the twelve engineer-weeks Ines assigned when she approved the pilot, freed by deferring a reporting refresh to the following quarter; the displacement is written into the plan so the same weeks are not promised twice. What is unfunded is only the acceleration.

Now the likely failure: May arrives and the board has not decided. Silence does not resolve the question, so the record already says what happens. If the hiring approval has not arrived by May, Alex brings the January option back to Ines and communicates the currently authorized plan. Ines can escalate to the board chair for a decision between meetings or confirm January; either way the team is told, in writing, that January is the plan it is executing, with the cash and engineer-weeks it already has. Existing customer commitments still require an explicit decision: any promise made against the October date needs Ines to decide whether to renegotiate it, fund a contract specialist for the peak quarter from the discretionary capacity within her delegation, or take the hiring back to the board. Nobody keeps working toward October on the assumption that money will appear.

Recorded, the decision reads: chosen option, the first stage delivered in January with the current team, or in October if the board approves the two hires in May; alternatives rejected, an unconditional October promise, and contractors booked now against a hiring budget that has not been approved; funding, €210,000 authorized by Ines and identified in the cash plan for January, while the two hires, about €175,000 this year and about €300,000 a year recurring, remain a board decision; scarce capacity, twelve engineer-weeks of the current team, already scheduled, and the one implementation specialist who understands the current configurations; authorized, Ines within her delegation for the stage, the board for the hires; evidence that would change it, a signed customer commitment tied to October, which would make the hiring decision urgent rather than optional.

![Approval, funding and capacity must be confirmed before a conditional plan becomes a delivery commitment.](private-techuity/posts/05-decide-who-decides/assets/images/05-decide-who-decides/conditional-commitment-gates.jpeg)

**Figure 2:** *Record the condition, the person who can resolve it and the decision date.*

{id: decide-who-decides--reporting-that-asks-for-a-decision}
## Reporting That Asks for a Decision

A board report should connect material outcomes, interpretation and the decision needed. A traffic-light dashboard without an evidence trail can conceal more than it reveals: “green” might mean on time, within budget, lower risk or simply that no one has escalated a problem.

For the onboarding work, a fictional three-sentence update does the job: “Across the first eight customers, implementation effort fell from 80 to 62 hours, short of the 50 we assumed, and about 40% of the remaining hours trace to customer data quality rather than the product. We propose a data-quality step, €40,000 and four engineer-weeks, before deciding on further implementation hires. Decision requested: approve the €40,000 from the reserve at this meeting; the hiring decision returns at the next quarterly review.”

Why does €40,000 go to the board when Ines may approve €500,000? Because of the delegation rule recorded earlier. The reserve belongs to an envelope the board approved, so drawing on it is a board decision; and the draw would fund a data-quality step the approved plan did not contain, which changes what the envelope funds. Ines’s €500,000 covers spending inside the plan, not either of those. It is the same path [You Cannot Fund Every Good Project at Once](#cannot-fund-everything) follows when its recovery retest draws on the reserve. The hiring decision the update defers is the board’s in any case. The figures are the shared pilot record kept in the [Practical Tools for Ownership and Technology Decisions](#toolkit), which also holds the report shapes for an initiative and its outcomes. Keep reporting effort visible; a monthly questionnaire that no decision depends on consumes the capacity the shareholder wants to improve.

## Parallel Instructions Need One Accountable Leader

Direct access to engineers can help during **due diligence**, the investigation before an investment, or during a clearly scoped support assignment. It becomes a problem when engineers receive priorities from the investor’s adviser, the CTO and the investment team at once: a parallel reporting line without a mandate or accountability. For any assignment, name the accountable company leader and route conflicting instructions back to that person. How an adviser’s influence and information should be used, including the boundaries of confidential coaching, is the subject of [Is the Investor’s Adviser Helping, Assessing or Deciding?](#investors-adviser); the charter for a support assignment is in [Turn an Offer of Help Into a Useful Engagement](#useful-engagement).

{id: decide-who-decides--disagreement-without-evasion}
## Disagreement Without Evasion

A leader should be able to say: “We can deliver the cost target, but not the current roadmap with it. Here are the choices.” An investor’s adviser should be able to say: “The evidence no longer supports the original thesis.” A board should be able to decide against a recommendation while recording what it is accepting.

A useful governance arrangement lets disagreement reach an accountable decision in time to act. The record should make clear who decided, which options were considered and what consequences were accepted.

Authority explains who can decide. It does not explain why the approver wants what they want. The next chapter reads the incentives behind the decision, what the executives’ shares, the fund’s carried interest and the employees’ jobs each stand to gain or lose: [Management Equity, Fund Carry and Employee Jobs Are Different Bets](#different-bets).

{id: decide-who-decides--questions-to-consider}
## Questions to Consider

1. *For the most important technology decision ahead of your company, who recommends, who is authorized to decide, who funds, who implements, and by when? Can you name people rather than roles?*
2. *When an adviser from the investor makes a suggestion, how do your engineers know whether it is an idea, an assessment or an instruction?*
3. *Which of your current commitments depend on an approval or hire that has not yet arrived? Is the condition recorded, with the decision date and what happens if the date passes?*
4. *When shareholders or board members disagree, which forum resolves the choice? Are incompatible requests being carried into the team’s backlog instead?*

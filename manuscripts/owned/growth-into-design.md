# 14. Turn “We Expect Growth” Into a Design Decision

![Turn “We Expect Growth” Into a Design Decision — logo](private-techuity/posts/13-growth-into-design/assets/images/13-growth-into-design/logo.jpeg)

> **IN THIS SECTION, YOU WILL:** Learn to recover the business requirement behind a request for flexibility, compare implementation options against it and choose one with its funded transition.

> **WHY INVESTORS CARE:** Growth is the assumption the valuation rests on; investors need the design choice that makes it possible to be funded, dated and reversible, not a request for flexibility with no cost attached.

> **WHY YOU SHOULD CARE:** “Make it more flexible” funds nothing on its own; a design chosen without the recovered business requirement is either over-built or wrong, and both cost cash before benefits arrive.

> **KEY POINTS:**
>
> * An investor’s growth assumption reaches the team as a request for flexibility. **Recover the business requirement** before comparing designs: which changes must become easier, for which customers, by when.
> * Compare **options against that requirement**, not against each other’s fashion: the same customer need, delivery date, ongoing responsibility and cash limit. Choose one under stated assumptions and name the evidence that would reverse it.
> * Follow **spending and benefits through time**. An attractive future saving still needs funding before it arrives, and a design that adds operating responsibility adds a cost line the next review will question.

Suppose an investor expects Larkspur to grow quickly, and the technology team is asked to make the software “more flexible.” The request leaves out its reasoning, and that is the condition this chapter starts from. Any company translates financial expectations into technical work; what is particular here is that the assumption arrived as a demand, with the customers, dates and constraints behind it left with the investor. The leader’s task is to recover that reasoning, which changes must become easier for the growth to happen, and turn it into an implementation choice the company can fund.

A **valuation assumption** is a belief used when estimating what a business is worth, such as an expectation of future sales or profit. An **operating requirement** states what the company must do to make that belief plausible. An **implementation choice** is how the company meets that requirement in its technology: how the systems are structured, what is built, what is bought, and how the parts fit together. The examples below come mostly from software a company builds; the same reasoning applies across the landscape of systems, suppliers and integrations the company runs, when the choice is which supplier system to adopt or how deeply to integrate it.

The boundary with the two preceding chapters is deliberate. The chapter [Can the Team Deliver What the Plan Promises?](#can-the-team-deliver) produced the assessment this chapter uses. Its finding for fictional Larkspur’s second country was: *market entry depends on coordinated changes to billing, legal work, support and product configuration, because the country rules are coupled into the invoicing module that all four read; every engineering change to those rules passes through the same two specialists and takes about three weeks end to end.* The chapter [Headcount Is Not Capacity: Trace the Work Before You Hire](#fix-decisions-before-hiring) dealt with the organizational half: delegation removed the decision waits, and one billing engineer is being brought into the module. This chapter takes the system half and chooses. It does not repeat the assessment.

{id: growth-into-design--recover-the-requirement}
## Recover the Requirement

“We are valued on growth” is incomplete. Growth in which customers, products or markets? How many will stay, what will it cost to serve them, and what further investment is required? “We are valued on **EBITDA**”, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is also incomplete. Which year’s earnings, under which adjustments, and how will the company sustain them? The chapter [A Valuation Is an Estimate, Not a Fact](#valuation-is-an-estimate) introduces the terms.

If much of the valuation depends on expansion, management may weight learning quickly, entering markets and onboarding customers, and may accept lower current earnings to build those capabilities if the cost, funding and evidence justify it. If much of it depends on repeatable earnings, management may weight cost to serve, reliable operations and predictable investment. Neither removes the other: a growth plan with worsening cost per customer needs cost work, and an earnings-focused company whose product is becoming obsolete needs experimentation. The useful question is which business uncertainty or constraint matters most right now.

For Larkspur, recovered from the investor’s reasoning, the requirement is: invoice, contract with, support and onboard customers in a second country under that country’s tax and pricing rules, with first paying customers within twelve months; and, because the thesis assumes a third country within two years, adding a country must become cheaper each time. That is what “more flexible” meant.

{id: growth-into-design--what-each-priority-asks-of-the-design}
## What Each Priority Asks of the Design

A valuation method doesn’t dictate an implementation. The overview below names, for each business priority, the trade-off the design has to face. Two shorter tables then separate the questions for a system the company builds from those for one it buys; a common arrangement is a bought core with built extensions around it, so many readers will need both.

| Business priority implied by the thesis | Trade-off to evaluate |
| --- | --- |
| Learn which products or markets can grow | Flexibility costs effort; elaborate infrastructure can slow the learning it was meant to enable. |
| Serve more customers without proportional cost growth | Sharing resources may lower unit cost while increasing coordination or failure exposure. |
| Improve sustainable earnings and cash generation | Savings depend on a completed transition; cutting resilience or development can damage future earnings. |
| Combine acquisitions or prepare a separation | Integration can improve the customer offer but reduce local flexibility and complicate a later separation. |
| Reduce dependence on a single supplier or person | Compare the dependency’s possible impact and likelihood with the cost and effectiveness of the alternatives; include consequences the company cannot accept. [Prove You Can Restore, Not Just That You Back Up](#prove-you-can-restore) shows why a rare failure can still dominate a decision. |

**If the company builds the system.** A few terms first. **Modularity** means dividing software into parts with clear responsibilities and connections. **Feature flags** let a team enable or disable selected behavior without releasing a new version each time. **Tenant isolation** keeps different customers’ data or workloads appropriately separated in a shared service. **Interfaces** are the agreed ways software parts exchange information.

| Business priority | What to examine in a built system |
| --- | --- |
| Learn what can grow | Isolated changes, configurable workflows, feature flags, reliable deployment and experiment measurement |
| Serve more customers | Automated onboarding, capacity management, appropriate tenant isolation and cost visibility |
| Improve earnings and cash | Remove duplicate systems, simplify operations, automate repetitive work, retire unused infrastructure |
| Combine or separate | Clear product boundaries, reliable interfaces, portable data and explicit shared-service dependencies |
| Reduce a dependency | Spread knowledge beyond the one or two people who hold it |

**If the company buys the system.** **Configuration** changes behavior through settings rather than by changing the software itself. **Customization** means altering a supplier’s product beyond its intended settings, which often makes later upgrades harder. **Exit cost** is what the company would spend to move to another supplier, including moving its data and retraining its staff.

| Business priority | What to examine in a bought system |
| --- | --- |
| Learn what can grow | Configuration depth without custom code, a sandbox to test in, and how quickly the supplier delivers a needed change; customizing to gain flexibility can remove it at the next upgrade |
| Serve more customers | How licence and consumption charges scale with customers; a price per user or per transaction can erode the margin the growth plan assumes |
| Improve earnings and cash | Consolidate overlapping products, renegotiate at renewal, retire licences still being paid for; a negotiated discount can be reversed at the next renewal |
| Combine or separate | Whether licences transfer on a sale, whether data can be exported in usable form, and which contracts bind the whole group |
| Reduce a dependency | Know the exit cost, the notice period, and whether an equivalent supplier exists |

A growth-oriented company might need modular boundaries because teams must change a few parts of the product independently. **Microservices** are smaller services that can be deployed and operated separately. Modular boundaries don’t automatically require them. A modular application with one deployment can be cheaper and easier for its team to operate; separately deployed services become an option when their specific independence is worth the extra operating work.

A company that buys most of its systems faces the same question in a different form: flexibility comes from staying close to the supplier’s intended use, so upgrades stay routine, and from keeping its own distinctive work in parts it controls. Heavy customization loses both, and the knowledge of why the product was changed leaves with the people who changed it. Equally, a blanket preference for the lowest immediate cost is not an earnings strategy. A reliable **managed service**, operated by a supplier on the company’s behalf, can cost more on an invoice while reducing the total work of operating the product; a commitment that lowers this year’s hosting price may limit the ability to shrink or change later.

**Figure 1:** *Implementation choices need a specific business priority and an explicit account of their trade-offs.*

{id: growth-into-design--three-options-for-one-requirement}
## Three Options for One Requirement

Alex and Priya compare three ways to meet Larkspur’s second-country requirement. Every figure is fictional. The cash limit comes from the plan Sam has confirmed: up to €300,000 of additional cash this year for the expansion’s technical work. This is a separate, later scenario from the hundred-day plan in the chapter [The First Hundred Days: Turn Expectations Into a Funded Plan](#first-hundred-days), whose €500,000 envelope deferred the expansion beyond year one and whose own €300,000 figure was the annual cost of two deferred hires; the €300,000 here is a fresh envelope for the expansion once the board has taken it up, and the months below count from that decision. The billing engineer from the chapter [Headcount Is Not Capacity: Trace the Work Before You Hire](#fix-decisions-before-hiring), about €90,000 a year from the operating budget, is needed under every option, so his pay is not counted again here; the options differ in how much of his time they consume. The scarce capacity is the two invoicing specialists. Effort is counted in **engineer-weeks**, one person for one week: “six specialist-weeks” means six weeks of specialist effort in total, three from each, spread across the work, not six elapsed weeks. Costs are compared on one basis: additional cash in the first year, then the recurring cost in each year after it.

| | A. Configure a supplier | B. Own the boundary | C. Replace the core |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What it is | Adopt a bought tax-and-billing service for the second country, configured for its rules and integrated with the existing invoicing module through its export | Extract the country rules from the invoicing module behind an interface Larkspur owns; migrate the first country onto it, then add the second as configuration | Replace the billing and configuration core so that all country rules become configuration, as costed in the assessment |
| First second-country invoice | Month 4–5 | Month 8 | About month 12 |
| Additional cash, first year | €100,000: €60,000 setup plus the first €40,000 annual subscription, billed at go-live | €140,000: a contractor covering the specialists’ product work during the extraction, plus test tooling | €1.3m over eighteen months, roughly €720,000 of it in the first twelve months (twelve of the eighteen capacity-months and half of the parallel running costed in [Can the Team Deliver What the Plan Promises?](#can-the-team-deliver), before migration costs) |
| Recurring cost and responsibility after the first year | €40,000 a year per country, rising with invoice volume; the supplier maintains tax rules, Larkspur maintains the integration, and finance reconciles two billing paths, a staff cost rather than a cash line | No supplier fee; the billing engineer maintains the country-rules component within his already funded role, and each further country is configuration | Larkspur operates a new core; the maintenance saving arrives only when the old one is retired |
| Engineer-weeks and scarce capacity | 8, of which two are specialist-weeks | 16: six specialist-weeks, three from each, and ten from the billing engineer | Four people for eighteen months; the specialists throughout |
| What it preserves or sacrifices | Fastest and cheapest now; leaves the coupling in place and adds a second billing path per country | Touches the fragile module, so existing invoices carry regression risk; removes the coupling for every later country | Broadest capability; far exceeds the cash limit, leaves no margin against the twelve-month date, and the retirement condition is unresolved |

On that basis B costs **€80,000 more upfront** (€140,000 against A’s €60,000 setup) and €40,000 more in the first year (€140,000 against €100,000). From the second year B costs nothing further while A costs €40,000 a year, so A’s cumulative cash reaches €140,000 after year two and €180,000 after year three; a third country on A adds its own setup and another €40,000 a year. B is the cheaper design only if Larkspur keeps it beyond the second year or the third country arrives. Both are assumptions, and the record below says so.

They choose **B**, under three explicit assumptions. First, the thesis’s third country is real; that is what makes B cheaper than A within the holding period. Second, the six specialist-weeks are available, which is true only because the delegation changes in the previous chapter hold. Third, last year’s invoices can be replayed through the extracted rules to detect regressions before any customer sees them.

Rejected: A, because it meets the date but leaves the constraint that made expansion hard in the first place and adds a reconciliation burden the growth plan would multiply; it is held as the fallback, priced at €60,000 setup plus €40,000 a year, not at €60,000. C, for the reasons in the table; it would be reconsidered only if a third country and larger customers made the whole core the constraint rather than the country rules.

Funding: €140,000 of the €300,000 envelope. The €160,000 left unspent is not an estimate of the fallback’s cost; it is the headroom that would fund the fallback’s first year if it is invoked. Scarce capacity: six specialist-weeks, protected in the plan. Authority: the Larkspur board approved the envelope; Ines authorizes the choice on Alex and Priya’s recommendation; Alex is accountable for delivery and Priya for the country requirement being met, including the legal and support work engineering cannot do. Evidence that would reverse the decision: if by month four the replayed invoices show differences the specialists cannot explain within two weeks, or incidents consume the protected time, Larkspur switches to A for the second country and stops B in the state described below; if fewer than five signed customer commitments exist in the second country by month six, the go-live is deferred and the boundary work continues for the first country only; if the third-country assumption disappears from the thesis, A becomes the better answer and B stops.

The first trigger needs its state spelled out, because a “safe intermediate state” cannot assume that the extracted path is safe. **Until the extracted component passes the invoice replay, the existing invoicing module remains authoritative** for every first-country invoice; the extracted path runs only in replay, and no customer is billed from it. If the replay fails at month four, the component stays switched off, the extraction stops, and whatever passed is kept as documented work, not as a live system. By then about €80,000 of B’s €140,000 has been spent, four months of the contractor plus the test tooling bought early because the replay needs it, and that money does not come back; the remaining €60,000 of B’s budget is not spent, because the contractor stops. The incremental fallback commitment is A’s €60,000 setup plus €40,000 a year, shown as two lines. Ines can authorize it from the €220,000 of the envelope still unspent, because the fallback and its trigger are part of the decision the board’s envelope covers, and reports the switch at the next board review; €120,000 would remain after A’s first year. Timing still fits, narrowly: a switch decided within the two-week explanation window after the month-four replay, plus A’s four-to-five-month lead time, puts the first supplier-issued invoice around month nine or ten, inside the twelve-month window with two to three months’ margin and no room for a second false start.

{id: growth-into-design--a-bounded-illustration-paying-for-a-saving}
## A Bounded Illustration: Paying for a Saving

The choice above buys capability, not a cash saving. A **separate payback example** shows how a saving is financed, and it should not be added to the decision above. Assume one proposed change at Larkspur costs €200,000 in cash now and is expected to avoid €100,000 of annual external setup costs after a one-year implementation. Assume those supplier payments really can be avoided and the €100,000 is the annual cash saving after any added operating and maintenance costs. The €180,000 pilot in the chapter [The Path From Roadmap to Revenue Is Fragile](#roadmap-to-revenue) illustrated staff capacity; this example illustrates cash savings. The two shouldn’t be added together either.

An earnings discussion examines the recurring cost reduction and its effect on the relevant earnings measure. A cash discussion must include the initial payment, the year’s wait and the timing of savings. A growth discussion asks whether easier onboarding also removes a constraint on selling and serving more customers. An implementation discussion asks which configuration or integration boundary would deliver the improvement without a much larger rewrite. These are complementary views of one proposal. The first €100,000 saving arrives during the second year, not immediately after approval; cumulative undiscounted savings recover the €200,000 after two full years of savings, about three years after the initial investment. That is a **simple payback** calculation; it ignores tax, discounting, timing within each year and uncertainty.

A **valuation multiple** expresses business value relative to a financial measure, such as annual EBITDA. At an unchanged 10× EBITDA multiple, €100,000 of additional annual EBITDA corresponds to €1 million of enterprise value. That is a sensitivity calculation, not an independently established project value: it assumes the saving is sustainable, the relevant EBITDA definition reflects it, the multiple stays unchanged and other effects don’t offset it. The initial investment also affects cash and potentially net debt. Adding both that €1 million and the present value of the same future savings would double-count the benefit.

If Larkspur can’t fund the first year, the project may be **economically attractive and currently infeasible**. It could phase the work, seek funding or choose another intervention. Valuation doesn’t remove the financing constraint.

![Cash is spent before implementation produces recurring net savings, leaving a period that must be funded.](private-techuity/posts/13-growth-into-design/assets/images/13-growth-into-design/cash-before-benefits.jpeg)

**Figure 2:** *A promising future saving still needs an affordable route through the implementation period.*

{id: growth-into-design--other-owners-other-hypotheses}
## Other Owners, Other Hypotheses

The same discipline applies when the expectation comes from a different owner. A corporate parent may value using Larkspur across its own customer base; the implementation question becomes which interfaces and operating responsibilities enable that use, with a named company sponsor and budget. A buyout plan may emphasize cash generation; the case then needs the transition costs and the time before any saving reaches cash. A new funding round may require evidence of an option worth developing further, without funding the full option today. None of these assigns a guaranteed valuation premium to a technical feature: **show the technical evidence separately from the financial inference**, and say which funding or commercial commitment must arrive before the next design stage is justified.

{id: growth-into-design--the-decision-record}
## The Decision Record

The CEO, CFO, product leader and CTO record five answers together, drawing on the investor’s adviser where useful. For Larkspur’s second country they read:

1. **The value assumption:** the growth thesis assumes a second country within twelve months and a third within two years; each country’s signed customers and revenue are the assumption’s test.
2. **The operating requirement:** invoice, contract with, support and onboard customers under the second country’s tax and pricing rules by month twelve, with each further country cheaper to add than the last.
3. **The technical options:** configure a supplier (month four to five, €60,000 plus €40,000 a year per country, keeps the coupling); own the boundary (month eight, €140,000 once and no supplier fee, removes the coupling, regression risk on existing invoices); replace the core (broadest, €1.3m, far beyond the cash limit and with no margin against the date).
4. **The funded transition:** option B, €140,000 of the €300,000 envelope in the first year, sixteen engineer-weeks including six protected specialist-weeks, maintenance inside the billing engineer’s funded role, first second-country invoice in month eight; option A held as the fallback at €60,000 setup plus €40,000 a year, fundable from the unspent envelope.
5. **The review evidence:** the month-four replay of last year’s invoices; five signed customer commitments by month six; the month-eight go-live; and the three reversal triggers above.

Then test the record against slower growth, a lower sale valuation and a longer ownership period, reassessing the remaining costs and benefits under each rather than defending the original choice. Under slower growth with no third country, A would have met the requirement. B’s €80,000 upfront premium is recovered only if the design stays in use beyond the second year, when A’s subscription would have overtaken it; its remaining benefit, faster rule changes for two countries, is released capacity that has to be measured the way the chapter [The Path From Roadmap to Revenue Is Fragile](#roadmap-to-revenue) measures the pilot, not a saving the board should be told was not wasted. The extra cash was spent on an assumption, and the record says which. Under a lower sale valuation, nothing in the design changes, because the choice was made against a customer requirement rather than a multiple. Under a longer ownership period, more of C’s later benefit, the maintenance saving after the old core is retired, falls inside the holding period, which changes the benefit side of a future comparison; it does not change C’s €1.3m cash requirement against a €300,000 envelope. C becomes a candidate only if a financing decision of the kind compared in the chapter [Match the Funding to the Work](#raise-what-you-need) supplies that cash.

Option B leaves Larkspur operating the country rules itself: no supplier fee, but the billing engineer’s time, the protected specialist time and the test tooling are now committed inside the operating cost, and the next visible line an investor will question is the hosting bill, because it is large, adjustable and improves the earnings measure directly. The chapter [Why a Cheaper Cloud Bill Can Be Bad News](#cheaper-cloud-bill) shows how to tell whether a lower bill reflects a real improvement or a worse unit of service.

{id: growth-into-design--questions-to-consider}
## Questions to Consider

1. *What does “more flexible” or “lower cost to serve” mean in your company’s case: which changes must become easier, for which customers, by when, for the valuation assumption to hold?*
2. *For your most significant proposal, have you compared at least two designs against the same need, date, ongoing responsibility and cash limit, and written down what would reverse the choice?*
3. *Are the systems your company buys being customized in ways that trade upgrade flexibility for short-term convenience?*
4. *Would your chosen design still be right under slower growth, a lower sale valuation and a longer ownership period, and which of those changes the answer?*
